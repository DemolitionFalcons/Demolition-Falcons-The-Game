# Console-Version
A console version of the game. It's main purpose is to test the main logic of the game. Also the main concept of the database should be implemented and modified here before we transfer it to the main project. 

# Environment 
- EntityFrameworkCore
 
 # List of goals that this project has:
- Test the main logic of the game and get an overall idea how some of the aspects of the game should act
- Implement the command pattern properly
- Get rid of potential bugs before they appear in the main project
- Create the initial version of the database
- Test most of the features before they become available for implementation in the original program
- Add simple console visualisation 
- Create different types of levels
